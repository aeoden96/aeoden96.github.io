# Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe built with React. Try to get three in a row before your opponent does!

## Play the Game

<TicTacToe client:visible />

## How It Works

This game is built using React and features:

- Real-time game state management
- Turn-based gameplay
- Win condition detection
- Game reset functionality

The game logic tracks the state of the board, determines the current player, checks for winners after each move, and allows you to reset the game at any time.

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid
2. Players take turns placing X or O in empty squares
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
4. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw

## Implementation Details

The game is implemented as a React component that maintains the game state using React hooks. The board is represented as an array of 9 elements (3x3 grid), and the component handles:

- Rendering the game board
- Processing player moves
- Determining game outcome
- Managing player turns

In the future, I plan to add features like:

- Score tracking
- AI opponents with different difficulty levels
- Customizable board sizes
- Multiplayer support
