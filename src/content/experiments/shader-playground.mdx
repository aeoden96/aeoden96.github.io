# WebGL Shader Playground

This is an experimental page that demonstrates a simple WebGL shader playground. You can use this page to experiment with fragment shaders and see the results in real-time.

## Interactive Shader Example

Below is a simple WebGL shader that creates a color gradient:

```glsl
// Fragment shader
precision mediump float;

uniform float time;
uniform vec2 resolution;

void main() {
  vec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution.xy;
  
  // Create a simple gradient based on position
  vec3 color = vec3(uv.x, uv.y, sin(time * 0.5) * 0.5 + 0.5);
  
  // Output the color
  gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
}
```

<ShaderCanvas client:visible />

**What you're seeing:** This shader creates a gradient where the red component increases from left to right, the green component increases from bottom to top, and the blue component oscillates over time using a sine wave function. The shader runs in real-time on your GPU using WebGL.

## How It Works

This experiment uses WebGL to render shaders directly in the browser. The shader code is compiled and executed on your GPU, allowing for complex visual effects with minimal CPU overhead.

The shader canvas is implemented as a React component that:

1. Creates a WebGL context on a canvas element
2. Compiles vertex and fragment shaders
3. Sets up a simple fullscreen quad (two triangles that cover the canvas)
4. Passes uniform values for time and resolution
5. Renders the scene at each animation frame

In the future, this page will include:

- An interactive editor where you can modify the shader code
- Live preview of your changes
- Ability to save and share your shaders
- A gallery of example shaders to learn from

## Why Shaders Are Cool

Shaders offer an incredibly efficient way to create complex visuals by leveraging the parallel processing power of modern GPUs. They're used in:

- Video games for realistic lighting and effects
- Creative coding for generative art
- Data visualization
- Scientific simulations

Stay tuned as this experiment evolves with more interactive features!
